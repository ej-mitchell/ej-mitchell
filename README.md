# Bonjour!

👋 I’m Eiven

I'm a [transmasc] ⚧️ technologist with a deep interest in decentralized community building and degrowth.
 
In the past I've worked as a software developer 💻 but I took a break to focus on meeting the needs of my community.
 
This has looked like the following:
- Building websites to help grassroots initiatives share their vision 🔥
- Skilling up local activists in software privacy and in new tools 🛠️
- Educating myself on free, open-source options that use less energy 🍃
- And more!

Does this sound like something you're interested 💡 in? Do you want to work together?

Still not sure? [Check out my Gists!]
